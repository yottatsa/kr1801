	<h1>KR1801VM1 to ECB considerations</h1>
	<p>KR1801VM1 is a clone of PDP-11 CPU board that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Bus">Q-bus, also known as LSI-11 Bus</a>. It uses multiplexed A/D bus, and the bus is mastered by the processor card.</p> 
	<p><a href="https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org/doku.php?id=boards:ecb:start">RetroBrew EuroCard Bus</a> is more-or-less versatile 16-bit demultiplexed parallel bus with existing peripheals and reliable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_41612">DIN 41612</a> connector. Most of the signals are compatible with PDP-11, and the only trick is a bootstrap process of PDP-11.</p>
